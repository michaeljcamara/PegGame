# PegGame

**PegGame** is a logic puzzle game made with the Unity engine, based on the board game of the same name.  The rules for it are simple (as described by ![Instructables.com](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-solve-the-Triangle-Peg-Game/)):

1. You must jump each peg over another peg, but only if there is an open space.
2. Each peg you jump over must be removed.
3. You win if only one peg is left at the end of the game.

Although the traditional game includes 5 rows of pegs, you can use the slider to adjust the rows up to 20!
